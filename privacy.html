                Introduction
ZapIT! Medical is bringing the medical physics community into the mobile technology age! In
today’s demanding clinical environment, information should be easily accessible and easy to
use – saving you time and money.
At ZapIT! Medical we feel strongly that the social media of the future involves “micro groups” of
individuals that share a common thread. Oncologists, Radiologists, Physicists, Dosimetrists,
Therapists and Technologists have much to share about their profession. We want to provide
that micro group the vehicle to foster those relationships. The result, 'Better Medicine Through
Collaboration'.
Maintaining your trust is our highest priority, we maintain that trust by implementing the
following principles.
